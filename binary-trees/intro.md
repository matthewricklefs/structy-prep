# What is a Tree in programming?

- A tree contains many nodes.
- These nodes could also point to other nodes
- The lines between the nodes are called edges

## Terms To Use

Familial Relationships

- Parent & Child
  - This is a relative relationship
- Root
  - A node that has no parent.
- Leaf
  - A node that has no children (no outgoing arrows)
- Every tree has exactly one root with potential many leaves.

### Binary Tree

- Exactly one root.
- A tree where every node has at most two children
- Every node could also have zero or one children
- Exactly one path between the root and any node

### Ternary Tree

- A tree where every node has at most three children

### Singleton Tree

- A tree with only one root node
- Still considered a binary tree

### Empty Tree

- A tree with zero nodes
- Is still considered a binary tree
